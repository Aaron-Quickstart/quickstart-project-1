#Bake That Dough Website

####Project Description
#####This website contains a home page.  On the homepage is some information about the storefront as well as other locations to find our goodies.  There is an additional page on which one can find a full menu of everything we have to offer.  At the bottom of the Menu is a recipe request form.  The third page will be a "behind the scenes" page with bios of our bakers.

#Future Improvements

####Chef Stories
 - I would like to make buttons that will display the biographies one at a time depending on which button was most recently clicked.  Perhaps have a row of buttons across the top of the page to fill a given area with text.
 
####Menu Page
 - I would improve the user experience by adding a Photo Gallery beside the menu.
 - This gallery could scroll through several popular products

####Customer Testimonials
- Adding a page that includes positive customer reviews could encourage potential customers.
